# ****Predictonator Budgeteer****

### Punchline:
You are traveling abroad and want to know how your spendings will look like? The Predictonator Budgeteer will tell you based on algorithmic comparison between your spending habits and other Wise users' data.

### Project description:
Our project heavily emphasizes making one’s transactions transparent and easily understandable. The feature provides a general overview, as well as a detailed analysis of the user’s spending for a given period set by the client. The overview shows the user a summary of outbound transactions. The existing version exhibits the algorithm using a sample database generated by us, however, all of the necessary data already exists and can be accessed by Wise, given the user’s permission. The algorithm’s main objective is to organize Wise users based on locations and their spending habits. This creates a theoretical map of regions where people use Wise, whenever a user plans moving whether it’d be a business trip, or moving and settling down completely, we compare the clients in the respective regions with similar needs and spending habits. We give a prediction on the foreseeable impact on their budgeting and spending overall. Our project also provides the option to set up a custom monthly budget and tracks the client’s spending in real time. (It should be noted that in case the user doesn’t set up a custom budget, the feature will automatically set the previous month’s spending as default.)

### Improving the algorithm:
Given the time constraints, we employed a simplified version of the categorizing algorithm, where we sorted the entire sample pool by average spending by country, and divided them into groups, with the same amount of users in them. Using this method, given enough groups, we can give a sufficient estimate, which proves the concept, however, it overlooks a major part of real-life circumstances, where if we graph the average spending, it wouldn’t lead to a linear function.

Optimizing this, we could introduce a system, where we create the groups in another way, changing the number and size of groups by analyzing the available data. This can be done algorithmically using calculus tools or another approach might be using neural networks, where we would do the sorting and then try to minimize our error rate.

Another area which could be improved is the definition of regions, where we make the average calculation. In our algorithm, we used countries as regions, but with enough data, which we assume Wise has, this can be applied to cities or counties.
